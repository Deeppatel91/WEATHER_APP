# Weather App using ReactJS

*This project is my first React application, where I created a Weather App. The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time weather information.*

## About

*This Weather App is a part of my summer project where I delved into learning ReactJS. It allowed me to apply my knowledge of React components, state management, and fetching data from APIs.*

## Features
- Fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Displays real-time weather information including temperature, weather condition, and location.
- Provides a simple and intuitive user interface.

## Technologies Used
- ReactJS
- HTML
- CSS

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Obtain an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the code with your actual API key.
4. Start the development server by running `npm start`.
5. Access the Weather App in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
